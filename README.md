I struggled with getting the pages such as the individual tour pages to function in MODEL. I would get them working, but then ended up breaking something else.  

This ended up being a hybrid with the main pages functioning through a model, but then the individual pages having their own HTML file, despite the requirement for a single page.  There are several HTML files listed, but most of them are commented out and not called on, just there to show I was able to get the whole site together without the MODEL.

I ran out of time to finish, but I will continue to work on it so that I can learn this properly.
